The version of Infusion included in this folder was created using a custom build from the infusion master branch:

https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion

commit#: 47b15a3f8a2c16ee3474c7baf13c8a2798dce244

```
grunt custom --source=true --include="renderer, normalize"
```

The following directories were stripped out of the build since they contain code that is included in the infusion-custom.js file or is not required:

* README.md
* ReleaseNotes.md
* src/lib/infusion/src/framework/core/frameworkDependencies.json
* src/lib/infusion/src/framework/core/js/
* src/lib/infusion/src/framework/renderer/
* src/lib/infusion/src/lib/fastXmlPull/
* src/lib/infusion/src/lib/jquery/core/
* src/lib/infusion/src/lib/jquery/ui/jQueryUICoreDependencies.json
* src/lib/infusion/src/lib/jquery/ui/jQueryUIWidgetsDependencies.json
* src/lib/infusion/src/lib/jquery/ui/js/
* src/lib/infusion/src/lib/normalize/normalizeDependencies.json

Additionally, the testing framework from Infusion is used (tests/lib/infusion) and should be updated to a matching version. This directory is a copy of

https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/master/tests

* all-tests.html
* component-tests/
